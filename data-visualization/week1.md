# Has the learner clearly stated a research question and hypothesis? (2 points) 
There was a lot of anger in politics in 2012. Then question "W1\_B4: Generally speaking,
how angry do you feel about the way things are going in the country these days?"
allows us to look for qualities associated with this anger. (Codebook page 25.)

Is this a broad based anger or specific to particular groups in society? Specifically,
analysis will test the hypothesis that political anger is associated with viewing black americans
as "different" than one's own group. I will use personal questions like
willingness to date other races, family approval of mixed race relationships, and
views on bi-racial children to evaluate an individual's views on black Americans as
like them or not like them.

There are limits to this investigation. Even if an association exists, is it because
of a black president or has this anger always been there because it's directed at something
else entirely? An answer requires data from more years than are available.
Is the anger more strongly associated with other characteristics like income or education?
Hopefully we will cover techniques to investigate this in the next class!

Human connections and loyalty to a group can be a powerful influence on action and belief. Many groups have featured
physical characteristics like skin color and eye shape as a defining part of their identity. The President of the United States, for the first time, looks different than his
predecesors in a way Americans have used to distinguish "us" and "them". News reports suggest that this difference in physical appears has
generated a backlash among Americans that see him as outside their tribe.
Is the data consistent with these reports?

Searches used terms including "Obama", "anger", "tribalism", and "black president".

"Ontologically, tribalism is oriented around the valences of analogy, genealogy and mythology. This means that customary tribes have their social foundations in some variation of these tribal orientations"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribalism

"Tribalism is the belief in the supremacy of one’s group identity over the rights of individual human beings. Tribal identity fosters negative feelings, even hatred, toward those outside the tribe."

"The moment Obama spoke, the case of Trayvon Martin passed out of its national-mourning phase and lapsed into something darker and more familiar—racialized political fodder."

"Among white voters, higher levels of racial resentment have been shown to be associated with greater support for Trump."
