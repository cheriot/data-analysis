#### Could these be possible?
* Hyper specific, short term weather forecast. What does a 20% chance of rain even mean? 100% chance 20% of the city will be wet? 20% chance of anything getting rained on? What's a more meaning full communication? Consider the decisions being made. Which jacket, umbrella, sunglasses. [Use data from NOAA](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/numerical-weather-prediction). [Maybe applicable.](http://www.araya.org/archives/1183).
* Speech control where services provide nouns and the verbs that transition their states. Then allows for more flexible user statements than the command line like controls of current voice commands. So "Microwave, defrost mode, 30 seconds" and "Defrost for 30 seconds" both trigger the same command. Add features to every command like timing and relative references. (stove, burners in {1,2,3,4}, heat in {0,1,2,3}) triggered by "Turn down the stove in 10 minutes".
* Use github public dependencies (gemfile, package.json) to identify packages that are alternatives to each other. Aka, they are associated with the same packages and have similar descriptions, but rarely used with each other. By looking at the versions used together, could broken versions and bad version combinations be identified? Trending packages that might be interesting to your project. Identify diffs that upgrade a project and estimate how difficult the upgrade is.
