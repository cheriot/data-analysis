## Sample and Recruitment

The Outlook on Life sampled 18+ non-institutionalize individuals (N=2,294). A second wave of interviews of 1,601 individuals from the original sample was also conducted. Email reminders were sent to increase response rate. The sample contains a large oversample of black ethnics. My analysis in this course will be based on the 814 responses from white ethnics. An internet survey of an established panel was conducted between August and December 2012 in America. The panel had been created by random digit dialing and adress-based sampling and provided internet access and hardware when required.

The question, "I have concerns about having bi-racial [black] children", is used as a proxy for a respondants view of black Americans being in the same "tribe" or a different "tribe" than themselves. The question I want to investigate, statistical tools and sample size permitting, is what effect on political anger can be attributed to these views. Is the population large enough to control for gender, party affilliation, and income? Once these are accounted for, is there a significant association between views on race and anger?
